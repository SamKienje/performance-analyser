# PROJECT NAME 

Performance analyser

# Description
The goal of this initiative is to lessen the amount of extra work that teachers must do. This should make it possible for the instructor to quickly and easily input student data into the form that shows on the class list. From first to last, the material is shown in a sorted order. Students with scores greater than 85 will also be acknowledged. The website automatically places the students below the award table. The total mean grade for the class was also calculated by the website.
